</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Have you ever wanted to get into a podcast episode, but didn’t listen because it was too long? We're working on a podcast summarization tool called TL;DL, which transcribes a podcast's content and provides an easy to read summarization - no ads, no promotions. Reading a condensed summary of details from a podcast episode can give you a sense of what a new show focuses on or help you catch up on hours’ worth of content in minutes. Whenever you are catching up on previous episodes or browsing for something new, TL;DL will give you the synopses of the podcast of your choice and help you make better use of your time.</p>
<p>Unlike previous radio content, which directly broadcast content over the airwaves, today it is now captured, organized and made available for listening at a time of our choosing.  Given the now all but endless supply of audio content for individuals to explore, many uses exist for a summarization, which extends beyond just a hook or an overview of the content.  Such opportunities arise in the informational, educational, and pure entertainment arenas.</p>
