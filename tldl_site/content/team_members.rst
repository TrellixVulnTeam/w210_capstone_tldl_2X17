Inspiration for this project came from avid podcast listeners who were also practicing data scientists.  Brought together by the `UC Berkeley MIDS program <https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/>`_, this project represents a capstone experience that not only supported degree requirements, but also honed skills necessary to tackle present and future data challenges.
