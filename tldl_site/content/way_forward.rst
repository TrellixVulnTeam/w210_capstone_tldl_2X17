..............
Met Challenges
..............

Much was learned and accomplished in the development of the TL;DL model.  A unexpected challenge faced was generation of false information in the abstractive summaries.  Though visually satisfying and coherently written, they did not consistently reflect the actual content in their associated transcript file.

...........
Future Work
...........

Several areas are rife with potential future development.

#. **Refine transcription process.**  Using speech-to-text APIs has the potential to become cost prohibitive.  Developing solutions to mitigate this and or create libraries of summarizations to avoid redundant costs would prove beneficial to listeners.

#. **Improve Summarization Model.**
