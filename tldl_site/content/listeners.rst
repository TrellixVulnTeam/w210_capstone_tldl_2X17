To capture insights from current podcast listeners, a survey was distributed to a variety of sights, to include LinkedIn, Facebook Groups, and the MIDS Slack channel.  The survey results confirmed the the validity of initial assumptions and the potential interest in a text summarization tool for audio files.

..................
Types of Listeners
..................

Three distinct audience groups were identified within the podcast listenership.  These were:

  * Stalwart listeners searching with time constraints
  * Enthusiasts looking to quickly catch up on missed episodes
  * New listeners looking for targeted broadcasts

On a weekly basis, respondents had the following listening trends:

  * Followed on average 3 Podcasts
  * More than 50% listened to at least 1 hour of Podcasts
  * More than 50% listened to broadcasts at least 30 minutes long

...............
Concept Utility
...............

A founding assumption for this project was that listeners did not finish audio broadcasts.  Given that, audio synopses would actually be desired amongst listeners.  Survey results did confirm that many listeners did not finish broadcasts; however, granularity on rationale for stopping was not collected.  Respondents did consistently convey value for text summarizations.  Overall, 80% perceived that some level of value existed, with 40% indicating a moderate to high value.

A variety of utiliziations were provided in the survey.  Grouping responses into primary and secondary catagorizations.

Primary Utilizations (~60%)
  #. Obtaining talking points & takaways from a broadcasts
  #. Serving as a decision tool when exploring new Podcasts

Secondary Utilizations (~40%)
  #. Catching up on missed episodes
  #. Revisiting boradcasts previously listened to

.................
Value Proposition
.................

Independent research and survey results coalesed into an understanding of the value proposition that TL;DL would provide to listeners and audio consumers in general.

**Task:**  To support the efficient consumption of audio consistent

Pains:
  #. Burdensome time commitment
  #. Uncertainity on the level of interest with any one single audio files

Gains:
  #. Enhanced listener experience
  #. Expanded Listenership
  #. Easy to read summarizations for current or archived use
